# FundamentalsPokerGame
Create a dealer (server) that will simulate a 5 hand card poker game that will interface with other players (clients) that have GUI interfaces that will play the game.

1. Choose the option on the client to clone a repository with the URL:
	https://github.com/Randude14/FundamentalsPokerGame.git
	
	This will clone the project to your local file system


2. Any files you change will show up in the GitHub Windows Client. Before adding, enter a description and select "Commit to master"

3. Before working on the project, be sure to check that there aren't any file changes that need to be pulled from the repository.
